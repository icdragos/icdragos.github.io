                  <span class="abstract"><em><u>Abstract:</u></em><br />I connect two increasingly popular ideas in social epistemology: <em>group knowledge</em>, the idea that knowledge can sometimes be attributed to groups, and <em>epistemic extendedness</em>, the idea that knowledge can sometimes be attributed to individuals even when they cannot alone satisfy the normative conditions on knowledge. There are two consequences of connecting these ideas. First, a fundamental problem emerges with one major argument for the claim that group knowledge sometimes obtains. According to the <em>argument from extended justification</em>, group knowledge obtains whenever multiple individuals are necessary for satisfying the normative conditions on knowledge. I show that this argument overlooks the possibility that epistemic extendedness instead obtains in these cases. The second consequence is that epistemic extendedness at the group level becomes a possibility, clearing the way for a serious epistemology of inter-group and in-group/out-group dynamics. Since this possibility is unexplored, I offer some motivation toward it: two arguments for the claim that, if there is group knowledge, some of it is <em>extended group knowledge</em>.</span>

                  <span class="abstract"><em><u>Abstract:</u></em><br />Steve Fuller (2002, ch. 10) is critical of the <em>Forman Thesis</em>, which is the claim that Weimar physicists of the 1920s decided upon an indeterministic interpretation of quantum physics due to external, social pressures, and not bonafide, prototypically intellectual deliberation. According to Fuller, the Forman Thesis is ineffective against <em>intellectualism</em>. As a remedy, Fuller offers an Extended Forman Thesis, a general social historiography that he claims is more effective against it. I argue that Fuller’s Extended Forman Thesis is formulated against a caricature of intellectualism. What Fuller targets is a radical <em>voluntarism</em> and not the more moderate view his intellectualist opponents hold.</span>

I first recap the debate and address two of Tossut's objections. I then concede to a third: in Dragos (2016) I mistake Rolin's (2008) argument as a token of a more general argument I reject in a larger project. Now properly understood as a different sort of argument, I apply a criticism offered by de Ridder (2014) to Rolin's (2008) argument.

                  <span class="abstract"><em><u>Abstract:</u></em><br />Kristina Rolin and Brad Wray agree with an increasing number of epistemologists that knowledge can sometimes be attributed to a group and to none of its individual members. That is, collective knowledge sometimes obtains. However, Rolin charges Wray with being too restrictive about the kinds of groups to which he attributes collective knowledge. She rejects Wray’s claim that only scientific research teams can know while the general scientific community cannot. Rolin forwards a ‘default and challenge’ account of epistemic justification toward her argument that even the general scientific community can know because it’s sometimes the general scientific community, and none of its individual members, that attains epistemic justification. I argue that Rolin faces a dilemma: either she must herself be more restrictive about the kinds of groups to which she attributes collective knowledge or she must concede the general claim that collective knowledge obtains at all.</span>

                  <span class="abstract"><em><u>Abstract:</u></em><br />For many centuries, philosophers have debated this question: ‘Does God exist?’ Surprisingly, they have paid rather less attention to this distinct – but also very important – question: ‘Would God’s existence be a good thing?’ The latter is an axiological question about the difference in value that God’s existence would make (or does make) in the actual world. Perhaps the most natural position to take, whether or not one believes in God, is to hold that it would be a very good thing if such a being were to exist. After all, God is traditionally thought to be perfectly powerful and good, and it might seem obvious that such a being’s existence would make things better than they would otherwise be. But this judgment has been contested: somen philosophers have held that God’s existence would make things worse, and that, on this basis, one can reasonably prefer God’s non-existence. We first distinguish a wide array of axiological positions concerning the value of God’s existence which might be held by theists, atheists, and agnostics alike. We next construe these positions as comparative judgments about the axiological status of various possible worlds. We then criticize an important recent attempt to show that God’s existence would make things worse, in various ways, than they would otherwise be.</span>

Jeff Jordan (2003) criticizes van Inwagen’s argument and (Jordan 2011) defends his position against Michael Schrynemakers (2007). I present two criticisms of Jordan. Concerning his first paper, I argue that if it is plausible to suppose that there exist undetectable evils, Jordan’s argument is incomplete. Concerning his second paper, I show how Jordan fails to engage adequately with Schrynemakers’s reply and, more seriously, with the notion of satisficing implicit in van Inwagen’s No-Minimum argument. To draw out this second criticism, I make use of another debate in the philosophy of religion: the problem of no-best-world.</span>

Through readings from classical and contemporary writers, students are confronted with the ultimate questions of morality. What do “right” and “wrong” mean? Can moral beliefs be rationally assessed and justified? Are moral truths absolute or relative? Why be moral? What is the good or virtuous life? How ought we to live?<br /><br />This course is divided into three parts. In the first part, we will examine influential moral theories. Utilitarianism and Kantianism are systematic accounts of the difference between right and wrong action. Virtue Ethics accounts for the difference between virtuous and vicious character. We will conclude this section by discussing evolutionary ethics (and perhaps a little moral psychology). This will provide an interesting transition to second part of the course, when we will examine several skeptical challenges to morality. Are there objective answers to moral questions? Is morality relative to culture? Is it a matter of personal opinion? What’s the relationship between morality and science? In the final part of the course we will explore two moral issues: global poverty and the morality of war.<br /></span>

After all, there’s a general scientific community and science is divided into smaller communities and structures: sub-fields, research teams, etc. What’s important is to determine the sense in which social context is important for how scientific knowledge is generated. This course focuses on Thomas Kuhn’s famous book, <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, which has had a profound effects in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. After we work through <em>Structure</em> in Unit 1, we will explore several ‘post-Kuhnian’ debates/threads in Unit 2.

Is this correct, or are a growing number of philosophers and historians correct to disparage what they call the conflict myth? It’s also widely believed by theists, atheists, and agnostics alike that the only adequate grounds for objective morality is the existence of God. If so, then atheism implies moral skepticism, the idea that there are no objective moral truths. Is this correct, or can we understand objective morality as being independent of God? Last, while philosophers, theologians, and many others have been debating for centuries about whether God exists, few have considered whether we should want God to exist.

After a week on Pyrrhonian skepticism, there will be a brief unit on early modern epistemology: Descartes, Locke, and Hume. In Unit 2, we will explore the knowledge problem. In 1962, Edmund Gettier sent epistemologists on long hunt for the missing condition for knowledge beside justification, truth, and belief. We will survey influential proposals and how they led to what is called to the externalist turn in epistemology. This will naturally take us into Unit 3, where we will delineate models of epistemic justification, including coherence, as well as internalist and externalist virtue conditions. In Unit 4, we will consider how the more recent social turn in epistemology occurred. We will explore the most discussed topic in social epistemology, the epistemology of testimony, along with a related, recent, and quite radical idea, epistemic extension.</span>

This was the dominant worldview for two millennia. We will then track how the Aristotelian-Medieval worldview gave way to the New Science. Here it will be useful to compare Descartes’ more successful replacement of the Aristotelian-Medieval worldview with Galileo’s unsuccessful attempt. We will then consider Hume’s and Kant’s influential criticisms of Descartes’ proposed foundation for the New Science. This should bring us sufficiently up to speed for exploring recent and contemporary philosophy of science.<br /><br />In Unit 2, we will study logical positivism, the dominant early-20th-century view about meaning and about the distinction between science and pseudoscience. We will consider Thomas Kuhn’s work, which put the last nail in the coffin of positivism and which had profound effects on the philosophy, history, sociology, and other approaches to science.<br /><br />In Unit 3, we will spend several weeks on a central and overarching topic in the philosophy of science, the debate between realists and anti-realists. Very roughly put, realists contend that our theories ‘get at’ how reality really is; our theories are more and more closely approximating reality over time. Very roughly put, anti-realists contend that we cannot know, or justifiedly believe, that this is so. We will consider some of the alternate models they propose, as well as Hacking’s more nuanced, pragmatic realism.<br />We will conclude the course with two ‘bonus’ topics in Unit 4: (1) feminist critiques of certain aspects of scientific thought and activity, and (2) divergent views about what constitutes a law of nature.</span>

                  <span class="abstract"><em><u>Course Description:</u></em><br />This course stresses the development of skills necessary for effective intellectual analysis and argumentation. This will be accomplished through short writing assignments and regular quizzes. Students will learn about the basic components of valid and sound arguments and come to recognize common fallacies of reasoning. This course also includes introductions to categorical and truth-functional logic. Students will translate written arguments from assigned readings into formal structures that can be evaluated for validity and soundness. In short, this course aims to foster skills for clear thinking, persuasive argumentation, and concise, cogent writing.</span>

                  <span class="abstract"><em><u>Course Description:</u></em><br />In this course, we will explore core topics in two fundamental areas of philosophy, epistemology and metaphysics. Epistemologists are concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge and justified belief. How are certainty and knowledge related? Are all justified, true beliefs knowledge? Do I depend on others for coming to possess knowledge? What’s special about scientific reasoning? Metaphysicians, on the other hand, are concerned with the fundamental constituents of reality. What are the most fundamental principles and concepts? What is the relationship between the brain and the mind? Do I have free will? Here is a helpful example of the two ways we will approach issues in this course. Metaphysicians ask whether an external world exists and what its fundamental characteristics are. Epistemologists ask whether we can know or justifiedly believe that an external world exists or that it has certain fundamental characteristics.</span>
