                  <span class="abstract"><i>Epistemic extendedness</i> is the increasingly popular idea that (roughly put) knowledge can sometimes be attributed to an individual subject even when she cannot alone satisfy the normative conditions on knowledge. I claim, first, that a fundamental difference between <i>knowledge-that</i> and <i>knowledge-how</i> is that the former can be epistemically extended while the latter cannot. Second, since there are cases of knowledge-how for which no individual can alone satisfy the normative conditions on knowledge, knowledge-how must sometimes be attributed to groups. That is, <i>group know-how</i> sometimes obtains. Third, if this is correct, then <i>anti-intellectualism</i> about the relationship between knowledge-that and knowledge-how must be correct: knowledge-how does not reduce to knowledge-that.</span>

                  <span class="abstract">I connect two increasingly popular ideas in social epistemology: <i>group knowledge</i>, the idea that knowledge can sometimes be attributed to groups, and <i>epistemic extendedness</i>, the idea (roughly put) that knowledge can sometimes be attributed to individuals even when they cannot alone satisfy the normative conditions on knowledge. There are two consequences of connecting these ideas. First, it becomes clear that there is a fundamental problem with one major argument for the claim that group knowledge sometimes obtains. According to the <i>argument from extended justification</i>, group knowledge obtains whenever multiple individuals are necessary for satisfying the normative conditions on knowledge. I show that this argument overlooks the possibility that epistemic extendedness instead obtains in these cases. The second consequence is that epistemic extendedness at the group level becomes a possibility, clearing the way for an epistemology of inter-group and in-group/out-group dynamics. Since this possibility is unexplored, I offer some motivation toward it: two arguments for the claim that, if there is group knowledge, some of it is <i>extended group knowledge</i>.</span>

                  <span class="abstract">Steve Fuller (2002, ch. 10) is critical of the <i>Forman Thesis</i>, which is the claim that Weimar physicists of the 1920s decided upon an indeterministic interpretation of quantum physics due to external, social pressures, and not bonafide, prototypically intellectual deliberation. According to Fuller, the Forman Thesis is ineffective against <i>intellectualism</i>. As a remedy, Fuller offers an Extended Forman Thesis, a general social historiography that he claims is more effective against intellectualism. I argue that Fuller’s Extended Forman Thesis is formulated against a caricature of intellectualism. What Fuller targets is a radical <i>voluntarism</i> and not the more moderate view his intellectualist opponents hold.</span>

                  <span class="abstract">Silvia Tossut (2016) offers an insightful reply to my criticism (Dragos 2016) of Rolin (2008). I first recap the debate and address two of Tossut's objections. I then concede to a third: in Dragos (2016) I mistake Rolin's (2008) argument as a token of a more general argument I reject in a larger project. Now properly understood as a different sort of argument, I apply a criticism offered by de Ridder (2014) to Rolin's (2008) argument. With considerations from Wray's (2016) reply to Dragos (2016), I close by addressing a fourth objection from Tossut.</span>

                  <span class="abstract">Kristina Rolin and Brad Wray agree with an increasing number of epistemologists that knowledge can sometimes be attributed to a group and to none of its individual members. That is, collective knowledge sometimes obtains. However, Rolin charges Wray with being too restrictive about the kinds of groups to which he attributes collective knowledge. She rejects Wray’s claim that only scientific research teams can know while the general scientific community cannot. Rolin forwards a ‘default and challenge’ account of epistemic justification toward her argument that even the general scientific community can know because it’s sometimes the general scientific community, and none of its individual members, that attains epistemic justification. I argue that Rolin faces a dilemma: either she must herself be more restrictive about the kinds of groups to which she attributes collective knowledge or she must concede the general claim that collective knowledge obtains at all.</span>

                  <span class="abstract">For many centuries, philosophers have debated this question: ‘Does God exist?’ Surprisingly, they have paid rather less attention to this distinct – but also very important – question: ‘Would God’s existence be a good thing?’ The latter is an axiological question about the difference in value that God’s existence would make (or does make) in the actual world. Perhaps the most natural position to take, whether or not one believes in God, is to hold that it would be a very good thing if such a being were to exist. After all, God is traditionally thought to be perfectly powerful and good, and it might seem obvious that such a being’s existence would make things better than they would otherwise be. But this judgment has been contested: somen philosophers have held that God’s existence would make things worse, and that, on this basis, one can reasonably prefer God’s non-existence. We first distinguish a wide array of axiological positions concerning the value of God’s existence which might be held by theists, atheists, and agnostics alike. We next construe these positions as comparative judgments about the axiological status of various possible worlds. We then criticize an important recent attempt to show that God’s existence would make things worse, in various ways, than they would otherwise be.</span>

                  <span class="abstract">Peter van Inwagen’s ‘No-Minimum’ argument boldly rejects a proposition widely accepted by theists and atheists alike: God and gratuitous evil are incompatible. Jeff Jordan (2003) criticizes van Inwagen’s argument and (Jordan 2011) defends his position against Michael Schrynemakers (2007). I present two criticisms of Jordan. Concerning his first paper, I argue that if it is plausible to suppose that there exist undetectable evils, Jordan’s argument is incomplete. Concerning his second paper, I show how Jordan fails to engage adequately with Schrynemakers’s reply and, more seriously, with the notion of satisficing implicit in van Inwagen’s No-Minimum argument. To draw out this second criticism, I make use of another debate in the philosophy of religion: the problem of no-best-world.</span>
